I'm a marine geophysicist/geoscientist focusing on acquisition, processing and interpretation of high-resolution acoustic datasets.

Currently conducting my PhD (working title: "Investigation of the Origin of Seafloor Pockmarks on the Chatham Rise using Acoustic and Seismic Data") as part of the Marsden fund project "Geologic champagne: What controls sudden release of CO2 at glacial terminations on the Chatham Rise?".
